# DOM Learning - Basic DOM-Based Projects

Welcome to my DOM Learning repository! This repository contains several basic DOM-based projects that I have created to learn and practice JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. These projects cover fundamental DOM concepts such as selecting elements, event handling, modifying content, and interacting with the web page dynamically.

## Projects

### 1. [Guess Number Game](https://github.com/mastershuvam/GUESS-NUMBER.git)
A simple number-guessing game built with basic DOM manipulation. The game allows users to guess a number within a defined range, providing feedback on whether their guess is too low or too high.

- **Key Features**:
  - Number guessing logic
  - DOM updates for game state
  - Event listeners for user interaction

### 2. [Color Changer](https://github.com/mastershuvam/Color-Changer.git)
A simple app that changes the background color of the page. By clicking a button, users can cycle through different colors dynamically.

- **Key Features**:
  - DOM manipulation to change the page's background color
  - Event handling for button clicks

### 3. [BMI Calculator](https://github.com/mastershuvam/-BMI-Calculator.git)
A basic BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that takes the user's height and weight as input and displays the calculated BMI.

- **Key Features**:
  - Input validation and processing
  - Display dynamic results using DOM manipulation

### 4. [Real-Time Clock](https://github.com/mastershuvam/real-time-clock.git)
A real-time digital clock that updates every second using JavaScript's `setInterval` method. The time is dynamically displayed on the page.

- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time clock updates
  - Manipulating the DOM to display time
  - Basic understanding of JavaScript timers

## Skills Learned

Through these projects, I learned and practiced the following core DOM-related skills:
- **Selecting Elements**: Using `document.querySelector`, `document.getElementById`, and other selection methods to interact with HTML elements.
- **Event Listeners**: Implementing `addEventListener` for handling user interactions like clicks and form submissions.
- **Manipulating DOM Elements**: Modifying the content, style, and attributes of HTML elements.
- **Dynamic Content**: Using JavaScript to change or update the content on the web page in response to user input.
- **Timers**: Implementing `setInterval` and `setTimeout` to dynamically update content at specified intervals.
